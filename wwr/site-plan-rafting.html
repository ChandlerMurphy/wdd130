    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>
        The purpose of this website is to increase my company revenue by promoting the use of our tour guides and rental shops
        along popular rafting sites. We aim to inform potential clients of the fun, local rafting locations available around followed promptyly
        by information about our rental equipment and experienced guides. 
    </p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>
        Our primary audience are young, healthy adults who raft for fun or sport but who don't want to own their own
        equipment and would rather rent for cheap from us. We aim for those between 18 and 30 years of age who are most 
        likely to raft often and safely. We want to entice our young, adventurous audience to satisfy their need for thrills
        by using our equipment to go rafting anytime during the light hours of the day. We expect our users to most often
        access our site through a mobile device where they can schedule rentals and make reservations for services ahead of time.
