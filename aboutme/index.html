    <h2>Chandler Murphy</h2>
    <h2>Nickname: Murph</h2>
    <p>Born and raised in Utah, I have spent most of my life growing up in the wonderful town of Mt. Pleasant. Newly wed I now reside in Ephraim.</p>
    <p>I have been a lifetime member of and served a fulltime mission for: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.</p>
    <p>Currently I am studying to become a Software Engineer. I love the BYU Pathways Program and am inspired by its ciriculum to love learning. </p>
    <p>I love being outside but actually quite enjoy being indoors; spending time with family in both settngs.</p>
    <p>I look forward to my career as a web designer and software developer because it is a fun, broad field of work that entertains me and also provides for my family.</p>
