            This page displays my coding projects I have started or have completed. Ranging from websites made, to coding projects 
            finished, to other projects I'm perhaps working on: notable ones are all here! Considering that at my current level 
            I particularly don't know how to link all of my projects to this website I will have to settle for the name of 
            my completed project and what it does. In the future though I will learn how to implement code I have made into a 
            collection of projects for people to see.

            <p>* ID Badge Creator: Grabs Data from the user and puts it onto an employee card for printing.</p>
            <p>* A wide range of math calculators</p>
            <p>* Multiple choice stories: A program that tells a story, pauses for the user to choose a path or option, then continues with the story which can end in multiple ways.</p>
            <p>* Word Guessing Game: A game much like hangman that asks the user to guess a word provided hints and blank letter slots.</p>
            <p>* A Shopping Cart system: Similar to a cart you'd see on an online store, this program stores shopping items added to it, can remove it, show the total, and take you to checkout where tax and shipping will be included in the final price.</p>
            <p>* To Do Lists</p>
            <p>* Data Readers: Programs that sift through text files and give the programmer back a specific data type or piece.</p>
