            Welcome to my online personal website! This is an online site demonstrating my current skills as a website developer 
            for future employers, social media, and friends who may be interested in helping me grow my skills or hiring me to 
            develop a project for them. This serves as an online resume showcasing my current skills in the simple way I 
            share a little bit about myself, my history of work, and experience I have. This page tells a little more about who 
            I am, where I come from, and what you can expect from working with me! * Note this page is updated frequently and is 
            subject to updates as I wish to share more.
        </p>
        <p class="home-intro">
            My name is Chandler Murphy, I'm 21 years old, and I come from a family of 6. I was born in Taylorsville, Utah; 
            but moved to Mt. Pleasant, Utah, before the age of 8. I have lived there for most of my life, attending school 
            faithfully and remaining academically inclined throughout my highschool years. I love being with my family. 
            Collectively we love having “family board game nights”, going on camping trips, eating out at restaurants, attending 
            highschool sports, attending church, and visiting inlaws.
