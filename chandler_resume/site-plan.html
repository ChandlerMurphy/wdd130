      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I'm making a Portfolio Website about me to show future employers who I am, my experience, and what skills I wish to 
        develop. This is a fun and skilled way to show future employers who I am and what I can do by the way I present myself 
        in a website. Keeping future employers in mind, I'm making a Home page about me with links to two other 
        pages which share my experience, attributes, and goals.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        People will come to this site to review my online project demonstrating my current skills as a website developer. 
        It is meant to be shared with future employers, social media, and friends who may be interested in helping me 
        grow my skills or hiring me to develop a website for them. It serves as an online resume showcasing my current 
        skills in the simple way I share a little bit about myself, my history of work and experience, and projects I've done. 
        Links in the home page will connect from the Home page to two other pages: the “Work History” and “Experience” pages. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The initial “Home” page, also called the “About Me” page, will contain information about my personal life. 
        It will give informative text and pictures about who I am, where I come from, and what you can expect from working with me. 
        It will not be long in length but instead concise, simple, and quick to read so that the user can get a quick overview within 
        seconds or minutes of who they are talking to. Within this page will also be my contact info for those who wish to 
        reach out to me to learn more. Considering that this may be shared online through social media as well (rather than just 
        in a face to face transaction) having a few methods of contact will give users a vast range of options to contact and get 
        a hold of me. Links in a navigation bar will lead to the two other child pages: Work History and Experience. And their 
        descriptions will be given in their own content sections where users can learn more. 
      </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Work History Page</h3>
      <p>
        The Work History Page is its own area upon the website worth looking at. It will feel very much like a resume in the way 
        it will express my previous work history. But more than just having a page dedicated to more background about where I 
        come from this page will show the user also what skills I have developed from those previous jobs. Not to be confused 
        with content I will share in my Experience page, this part of the site will give more depth about the other skills I have 
        learned over the years that aren't just coding. I will share experiences and stories about teamwork, problem solving, 
        and hard work that a proficient programmer will need in order to code his best works. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea of the Work History page is also meant to stir viewers into considering why my diverse history of occupations would 
        make me fit for a wide variety of future jobs or companies. Seeing that I've worked a lot in retail, business, heavy labor, 
        and medical fields makes me a qualifying and versatile candidate for tough jobs that people may be searching for an experienced individual to solve.

      </ul>
      <h3>Experience Page</h3>
      <p>
        The Experience page is easily the page with the greatest potential for growth and display of current skills. 
        The idea of this page is to show viewers what I can do with code. Ranging from websites made, to coding projects 
        finished, to other projects I'm perhaps working on. Considering that at my current level I particularly don't 
        know how to link all of my projects to this website I will have to settle for the name of my completed project and 
        what it does. In the future though I will learn how to add the functions of my code to the website and I will be able 
        to better showcase my work on this page. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Primarily I want to show people what I can do with a website and with other coding techniques. Since this is a site 
        to show viewers that I am unique, this part of the website may include fun projects I've done such as games or puzzles. 
        Again, this site shows more than just what I've done but a bit about my personality and the kind of person people can expect to be working with. 
      </p>
